this recent research beyond search engines large-scale online communities,

consequential, albeit unidirectional relationships. Wikipedia provides
substantial value to both communities, with Wikipedia content increasing
visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find little evidence that these
websites contribute to Wikipedia in return. Overall, these findings
highlight important connections between Wikipedia and its broader ecosystem

our results also emphasize the key role that volunteer-created Wikipedia

additionally suggested that the reverse isa lso true: Wikipedia content

showed that the click through rates of Google SERPs (search engine results

Google is quite reliant on Wikipedia to satisfy user information needs.
Among other implications, this means that the Wikipedia peer production

substantial and largely unstudied impact on other websites. also raised

high-level structure of McMahon et al [33], this paper asks two overarching
research questions about relationship with SO and Reddit: RQ1: What value
is Wikipedia providing to other large-scale online communities like Stack
Overflow and Redd it? (i.e. Does Wikipedia content increase community
engagement and/or company revenue?) RQ2: What value do these large -scale
online communities provide to Wikipedia? (i.e. Are they contributing page

al. and investigate how the quality of Wikipedia articles affects the
relationships examined in RQ1 and RQ2. In other words, we look at the
association between the quality of articles on Wikipedia and the value that
Wikipedia provides to external entities, and vice versa. associative and

Wikipedia community plays in the broader o nline ecosystem outside of

research on solutions to the paradox of re-use. BACKGROUND Prior to
presenting related work, we first provide high -level context about Reddit,
SO and how Wikipedia content appears on these sites. For both Reddit and SO
, there is a class of posts that is highly-dependent (if not entirely
reliant) on Wikipedia content (i.e. the posts could not exist without
Wikipedia). Additionally, on Reddit and SO , which gives it a (# of upvotes
# of downvotes). Reddit and Wikipedia Reddit is a large-scale online
community that allows users to share links to external content ( e.g. news
articles, images, videos), post original text content (e.g. questions,
opinions) , and discuss this content through comments. As of July 2017,
Reddit is the ninth -most-visited website globally [63], has 300M monthly
visitors, and has a $1.8B valuation [64]. The term On Reddit, links to
Wikipedia often appear in the well . refers to the sub -communities

analysis to examine the counterfactual scenar io, Wikipedia links remained
unchanged content -wise, but instead had a link to a site other than
Wikipedia? The results of our analyses indicate that Wikipedia creates a
large amount of value for SO and Reddit, even in our lowerbound estimates .
More specifically, we observe that posts containing Wikipedia links on both
sites are exceptionally valuable posts, with engagement metrics like user
-voted scores much higher than posts that do not contain Wikipedia links
(often by a factor of at least 2x, and sometimes as much as 4x-5x). This
results in an estimated increase in revenue on the order of $100K/year for
both sites. However, we find little evidence that posts with Wikipedia
links provide direct value to the Wikipedia community . We were able to
replicate work that showed that Wikipedia posts on the popular Reddit
community ( Today I ) were responsible for a large spike in viewership .
However, our results suggest that this large effect does not or beyond

summary or quote from the article. An example TIL post is shown in Figure
1. Stack Overflow and Wikipedia th SO is a Q&amp;A community for
programmers and the 56 most-visited website in the world [63]. Stack
Exchange, the company that owns SO, raised $40 M of venture capital funding
in 2015, bringing it to a total of $70M raised [65]. On SO, Wikipedia
supports answers in the form of links and quoted text. Answers often use
technical terms or acronyms and include a Wikipedia link in lieu of
defining these terms. An example post that use s a Wikipedia link and quote
to support an answer is shown in Figure 2. RELATED WORK Wikipedia and Its
Internet Ecosystem This research project was directly motivated by two
recent developments related to Wikipedia and its broader Internet
ecosystem. First , the Wikimedia Foundation called on Wikipedia researchers
to focus on these relationships as part [49]. Second, recent work further
substantiated this call with new evidence showing how critical these
relationships can be , both for Wikipedia and for the Web more generally
[33]. With respect to the former , Dario Taraborelli the Head of Research
at Wikimedia urged the large community of Wikipedia researchers to refocus
their efforts on several new opportunities and challenges facing Wikipedia.
One of those challenges is better understanding how Wikipedia (and
Wikidata) content is used by external entities, the importance of this
content to those entities, and the effect on Wikipedia (and Wikidata) of
this external use. One concern of Taraborelli is that the increasing re
-use of Wikipedia content outside of Wikipedia will reduce traffic to
Wikipedia. This would weaken editor base over the long term, thus
diminishing the re-use value of Wikipedia content. Taraborelli called this
phenomenon the re-use below. Recent work by McMahon et al.[ 33] provided
clear evidence to substantiate Tar aborelli s argument about the
importance</region>

line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">quality metrics (and
therefore investment of community effort) map to external value. The early
evidence that motivated us to examine large -scale online communities
primarily came from two papers: Moyer et al. [38] and G&#xF3;mez et al.
[14]. Moyer et al. examined the causal effect of Reddit posts on Wikipedia
page views and found that sharing Wiki TIL community increased page views
to the corresponding Wikipedia articles. Below, we replicate this result,
but find that it does not generalize to other subreddits. While studying
the role of links on SO with regards to innovati on diffusion in the
software engineering space , G&#xF3;mez et al. [14] found an intriguing
peripheral result: Wikipedia links were the second most common external
link on SO. While we also observed that Wikipedia links are very common on
SO, we found little direct evidence that SO is contributing substantial
value to Wikipedia. UGC and the Physical World Through our research, we
also seek estimate the economic impact of Wikipedia content on external
entities . This lens on our results was motivated by very recent findings
from Hinnosaar et al. [23], which showed that improvements to Wikipedia
article content about places in Spain directly increased tourism revenue in
those places [23]. Analogous results have also been identified with types
of user-generated content (UGC) other than Wikipedia (e.g. [5,32]). Factors
Influencing Content Value A key methodological challenge in our causal
analyses below is identifying potential confounding factors for the
substantial increases in value we see associated with Wikipedia-linked
content on Reddit and SO. For example, users who post Wikipedia links may
also write longer posts, and longer posts may be more popular. To search fo
r potential confounds, we turned to the burgeoning literature</region>

    <region x="54.0" y="78.39" width="245.91" height="651.92"
line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">on Reddit, SO, and
other large-scale online communities. We present the literature used to
guide model decisions here, and summarize in greater detail how these
factors were operationalized in the Methods section. Specific factors
influencing value on Reddit From platform-specific work on Reddit , we
identified three major factors that can influence user votes (score) , a
value metric that we use in this paper . Previous work identified content
type [29] and title characteristics [22] as predictive of score on Reddit.
Additionally, Gilbert showed that content posted multiple times (i.e. a
particular image) that received a high score on later postings was often
postings [13], implying that popularity is highly contextual, and not
necessarily purely dependent on content itself. Specific factors
influencing value on SO We also identif ied three factors that influence
content value on SO. Anderson et al . found that contextual infor mation,
such as user reputation and time of arrival, were predictive of the
long-term value of SO pages as measured by page views [1]. Ponzanelli et al
. [41] showed t hat that adding readability metrics to simple textual
metrics (e.g. percent uppercase, number of characters) improved low-quality
post detection. Finally, Calefato et al. [4] identified promptness,
presence of a hyperlink , presence of a code snippet , and answer sentiment
as key predictors to be selected as the best answer by the questioner.
Research on other question and answer (Q&amp;A) sites also helped to inform
our model design. On Math Overflow, a math-focused version of SO, both
online reputation (points) and offline reputation ( number of publications)
were found to influence content popularity [50]. Harper et al. studied a
variety of sites including Yahoo! Answers and identified that the number o
f hyperlinks in an answer was an indicator of answer quality [18]. We
emphasize this potential confound in our analysis to understand the value
that Wikipedia links add beyond the value added by the presence of links
overall. METHODS In this section , we first present the two aspects of our
methodology that cut across our investigations of both research questions:
(1) data collection and (2) handling of current events . We then describe
our methodology specific to Study One (RQ1) and Study Two (RQ2). Datasets
We downloaded database tables corresponding to every Reddit post in 2016
from pushshift.io as hosted on Google BigQuery (metadata, i.e. the latest
score, last updated July 2017 [66]). We also leveraged the Reddit API to
obtain user information [67]. We used BigQuery to download full database
tables for all SO questions, users, and answers, starting July 31, 2008 and
ending June 11, 2017 [66]. Following statistical best practice [42], we
separated the analysis into two phases: an initial phase for developing the
methods and a testing phase for generating results. As we describe below,
many of our analyses required using</region>
    <region x="316.85" y="76.59" width="246.26" height="653.72"
line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">multiple ra te-limited
APIs (e.g. for calculating features for our causal analyses), so we
employed random sampling to minimize API endpoint load and to make query
times tractable. For each platform and phase , we used a random sample
composed of ~1M posts from the entire dataset (1.10% of all Reddit posts
and 4.46% of all SO posts) and, in the testing phase, an additional ~40K
posts from the subset of Wikipedia-linking posts (to ensure that we had
adequate Wikipedia links to pages of each class of article quality).
Defining of our research questions, i.e. the value that Wikipedia is
providing large scale online communities and the value that these
communities are contributing to Wikipedia. In this paper, we seek to
increase robustness and detect potentially interesting nuances by
operationalizing the notion of value through multiple metrics rather than
using just one (e.g. page views). Specifically, we measure post value in
RQ1 through four metrics. The first three me trics are user engagement
statistics: (1) Score, equal to upvotes minus downvotes , (2) Comments, the
number of comments a post receives, (3) Page Views, the number of views a
post receives. To contextualize these metrics, we also calculate (4)
Revenue, or the financial gain generated by Wikipedia posts . Revenue is
calculated directly from the engagement statistics using publicly-available
financial information (described in detail in Study 1 Results). In the case
of Reddit (which does not release page vie w data) , it is important to
note that score controls post visibility and correlates with page views
[48]. With respect to RQ2, we assess the value that Wikipedia receives from
external communities as contributions to the editing community and
increased readership. Specifically, we measure this value with four metrics
that capture changes in edits, editors, and viewership in a given week :
(1) Edit Count is the number of times an article was edited , (2) Editors
Gained is the number of new editors who edited an article, (3) Editors
Retained is the number of new editors who made another edit in the future
(we measured at one month and six months later, following past research on
editor retention [6,37]), and (4) Article Page Views is the number of views
that each Wikipedia article received. To capture the effect of Reddit and
SO on Wikipedia, we calculated the metrics for the week before and the week
after each post containing a Wikipedia link. Influence of Current Events
One poten tial confound of all our measurements is the impact of current
events on our value metrics. For instance, if Reddit users happened to post
Wikipedia links related to current events, then any subsequent increase in
Wikipedia page views might be largely driven by current events and not by
the Reddit post . We predicted, however, that very few posts with Wikipedia
links on either platform are related to current events because SO is
strictly for pr ogramming discussion and the Reddit TIL community does not
allow current events posts [68].</region>

line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">to a casual [71].
Specifically, we define our high quality and low-quality groups as follows:
C-class or Better: All posts with any links to C-class or higher articles
are in this group (79% of all Wikipedialinked Reddit posts and 77% of all
Wikipedia-linked SO posts). Below C-class: All posts in which all Wikipedia
links are to articles below C-class are in this group. Simulating a World
without Wikipedia (Counterfactuals) We cannot know how SO and Reddit would
function in a world without Wikipedia. Therefore, we draw upon well
established causal inference methods (e.g. [26,44]) that estimate the loss
in value that would occur to these communities if posts with Wikipedia
links were re placed with a range of alternatives (i.e. counterfactuals).
In other words, we consider how SO and Reddit would be affected if</region>
    <region x="54.0" y="247.62" width="246.72" height="482.7"
line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">To formally verify this
assumption , we performed a qualitative coding exercise. Following standard
practices [39], we used a small (10 posts per site) calibration procedure
with two researchers, achieved a 90% agreement , and t hen one researcher
classified an additional 100 posts per site. In this qualitative analysis ,
we identified that only 5 % of Wikipedia-linked Reddit posts were related
to current events, and no Wikipedia -influenced Stack Overflow posts were
related to current events. This gave us confidence that our results were
largely not driven by current events. STUDY ONE Our first stud What value
is Wikipedia providing to other large-scale online communities like Stack
Overflow and Reddit? Here, we present the methodology specific to this
question and then present our results. Study One Methods Controls and
Treatments In Study 1, our goal is to estimate the value that Wikipedia
provides to SO and Reddit . We study value through two separate analyses.
The various estimates are summarized in Table 1. First, we estimate the
effects that the presence of Wikipedia links has on value . We then
estimate the effects that Wikipedia article quality has on value. For each
analysis, following standard practice, we label the change in value in the
treatment group the group associated with Wikipedia content . We defined
three groups: Has Wikipedia Link: posts with at least one v alid link to
Wikipedia (as described below, this amounts to 0.13% of all Reddit posts
and 1.28% of all SO posts). Has Other Link : posts with at least one
external link, but no links to Wikipedia (49.1% of all Reddit posts and
31.2% of all SO posts). No External Link: posts with no external links at
all (50.8% of all Reddit posts and 67.5% of all SO posts). To estimate the
effects of Wikipedia article quality on value to Reddit and SO (the second
half of RQ1), we further subdivide the Has Wikipedia Link group into high
-quality and low-quality groups. While there are many definitions of
quality on Wikipedia [53], we rely on revision -specific</region>

line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">of different
assumptions. This approach provides a reasonable upper -bound, middle
-ground, and lower -bound estimate of the value contributed by the
Wikipedia community to SO and Reddit . In our consideration of the effect
of Wikipedia article quality, we take a similar approach and estimate the
loss in value if links to high quality Wikipedia articles were replaced
with a range of alternatives. We emphasize that causal analys es, the
statistical methods we employ, can estimate causal effects with confounding
effects reduced, but not eliminated (as in a randomized controlled trial)
[26,44]. Upper-bound Estimates: Our upper-bound estimate of the value
created by Wikipedia on SO and Reddit assumes that without Wikipedia, all
posts containing a Wikipedia link would not exist (i.e. would not have been
generated). For our analysis of quality, we make an analogous assumptio n:
we calculate the value that would be lost if all posts containing
high-quality articles did not exist. This upper bound is simply equivalent
to the Middle-ground Estimates: The middle -ground estimate corresponds to
the val ue that would be lost if the links to treated articles were
completely replaced with a n identical post with no links. In other words,
this scenario assumes that the links to Wikipedia were removed, but the
post still exists. Lower-bound Estimates: A lower -bound for value
contributed by Wikipedia can be obtained by estimating the value that would
be lost if the links to Wikipedia article were</region>

that identified factors that may affect post value in large-scale online
communities. Wikipedia link, a high-quality Wikipedia lin k, and a
lowquality Wikipedia link. By finding the difference between corresponding
estimates (Has Wiki Link vs Has Other Link and C-class or Better vs Below
C-class), we produce a robust estimate of the value that Wikipedia uniquely
provides , and the value that highquality articles uniquely provide. This
estimate is minimally affected by bias from hidden variables or incorrect
model assumptions because this bias should affect the corresponding
regressions equally. For instance, if there was a hidden variable at play
(perhaps users have a general unwillingness to visit external domains ),
that would affect posts with Wikipedia links and posts with external links
equally and be removed by taking the difference. The propensity score of a
given post is an estimated probability that the post was treated based on
all available covariates. I n our case, the covariates are the computed
features summarized in Table 2 (except for the number of hyperlinks, which
relates directly to whether there is a Wikipedia link). The actual
propensity score for each post is calculated by logistic regression and
represents how likely a given post is to include a Wikipedia link (or a
good Wikipedia l ink) based only on its features . P osts that have
features that are commonly found in Wikipedia -linked posts will therefore
have high propensity scores. Using the open -source causalinference [72]
library, we stratify [2] our datasets by propensity score (subdivide into
many subsets) in order to emulate a randomized blocked trial using
observational data. Each stratum contains posts with a small range of
propensity scores, so posts have similar features with each stratum , which
reduces the standardized bias (described by Rosenbaum and Rubin [45]).

alternative external domains . In other words, the lower-bound scenario
assumes that the exact same post (with alternative links) could be written
without Wikipedia, and so the added value reputation or other factors
associated with Wikipedia (in comparison to other websites) . In the
quality analysis, the lower bound is the estimate of value that would be
lost if links to high-quality articles were replaced with links to
lowquality articles (without other changes). Causal Analysis While the
upper -bound estimate is relatively easy to calculate using descriptive
statis tics, our middle-ground and lower-bound estimates require the
estimation of formal counterfactuals, which calls for causal analysis
techniques . One of the first steps in casual analysis is to consider other
potential causal factors, i.e. other reasons that Wikipediatreated posts
may have increased in value besides the Wikipedia treatment. To address
this challenge, we turned to the literature on factors associated with
content value, discussed above in Related Wor k and summarized in Table 2.
This review broadly shows that value may come from four sources other than
Wikipedia itself: user characteristics (e.g. users with high reputation),
stylistic and structural characteristics (e.g. long posts, posts wi th code
snippets, posts with punctuation), post timing (e.g. posting on a certain
day of the week), and the presence of any external link. We operationalize
these potential alternative causal factors through the calculation of
features that capture them. Some of these features are numerical (e.g. post
length) and others are dummy variables (e.g. whether the post includes code
snippets). While most of these features were very straightforward to
calculate (e.g. title length), readability and sentiment were mo re
complex. With respect to readability, we use the Coleman -Liau index [7],
which was used b y Ponzanelli et al. [41]. For sentiment, we used the
TextBlob library [31], which leverages sentiment analysis models (trained
on customer review text) from the well-performing [43] [47] to estimate
objectivity and polarity. Additionally, we log-transform reputation and
response time as they are otherwise highly-skewed variables. Further
details about these implementations are available in our source code, which
we have made publicly accessible for 1 download . In terms of our
statistical approach to c ausal analys es, we 2 performed four
propensity-score-stratified regressions . This method, originally described
by Rosenbaum and Rubin [44] has been used in the context of HCI for many
purposes and is an approach advocated for in the HCI community (e.g.

Overall, we were surprised to find that Wikipedia links represent only
0.13% of posted content on Reddit. However, further examining this result,
we found that Wikipedia links are substantially over -represented in high
-value locations. For instance, Wikipedia is the third most -linked site
(after YouTube and Imgur) on the ten most -popular subreddits. This
relatively low-quantity/high-quality dynamic is one we see frequently in
our formal analyses below. On SO, Wikipedia lin ks appear in 1.28% of
posts, but this makes them the fourth-most-common type of external link

of the treatment coefficients based on the number of treated items in each
stratum. In other words, a coefficient from a stratum with more Wikipedia

estimated effect . The weighted average is the Average Treatment Effect on
the Treated (ATT) , which is the main result we present . This value
represents how much value would be lost if all the treatment posts were
replaced with control posts with nearly the same covariates . The analysis
of SO page views requires special handl ing because page views correspond
to one question page, which could have many associated SO answers. This
means we must take care to avoid overestimating page view effects . When
computing mean page views for the upper -bound estimate, we only count each
question once. In our causal analysis (i.e. middle-ground and lower -bound
estimate), we make a conservative assumption that all page views are
attributed to the top -scoring answer for a question , which means that
only top answers are included in this analysis. Study 1 Results In this

line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">user-voted score of
between 13.1M and 18.4M points in 2016 (up to 0.7% of all points on the
site). Additionally, Table 3a also shows that Wikipedia adds 1119 comments
per post. This means Wikipedia -linked posts generate twice as much
discussion as average posts. In total, this amounted to between 1.3M and
2.3M comments in 2016. Effects on Stack Overflow posts: For SO, Table 3a
displays a similar trend to what we saw with Reddit. For instance ,
Wikipedia-linked content on SO adds 2.9-6.5 points per post, with a middle
ground of about 3.4 points. This means that Wikipedia-linked answers are
roughly twice as valuable as other answers and, across the 280K Wikipedia
-linked answers on SO , increased total score between 0.8M and 1.7M points.
This score increase is a ccompanied by a page view increase of 954-3473 per
question , with a middle ground of 1337. Estimating based on the 12K
questions with Wikipedia-linked answers in our page view analysis ,
Wikipedia may have added 64M to 234M views (which we use for revenue
estimation). However, we see no evidence of an effect on SO comments.
Overall, the presented estimates show that even assuming all authors could
continue writing the same posts , except with non-Wikipedia alternative
links, Wikipedia still adds significant value (i.e. through its brand or
other factors). Effect of Wikipedia Article Quality Compared to posts that
only have links to Below C -class Wikipedia articles, we find mixed
evidence that links to Cclass or Better articles contribute to value.
Relative to BelowC-class articles, C-class or Better articles add 61-163
points on Reddit ( 1.5-1.5x increase) . Similarly, C-class or Better
articles also add 8-21 comments on Reddit ( 1.6-1.6x increase). However, we
observe no effect on SO score, comments, or page views. The above results
suggest that article quality for the purposes of the SO community may mean
something different than article quality for the Wikipedia community (and
Reddit). For instance, SO members may not differentiate between the value
of short or stub-like art icles and longer, high -quality articles, as long
as those articles contain a specific piece of desired technical
information. Back-of-the-Napkin Revenue Estimation To better understand how
the results of Study 1 translate into real-world revenue for SO and Reddit
, we use the following -of-therevenue estimation s, incorporating as much
actual public financial information as possible and making conservative
assumptions (e.g. assuming all SO ads were sold for the lowest price
listed). Both platforms sell ads at a fixed cost per thousand impressions
and therefore revenue scales linearly with page views. Estimating 2016 ad
revenue is relatively simple, as Reddit only make s money from ads and

assume that every vote was made by a high reputation user, and therefore
the corresponding view should not be included in ad revenue). of 0.75 to

conservatively assumed all ads cost $0.00466 [77], the lowest price listed
in August 2017 and that users see only two impres sions per page (users who
scroll down actually see three). Finally, because Reddit page view data is
not available, we estimate page views using score, based on research
showing that the score of a Reddit post correlates with views [48].
Overall, under these conservative assumptions, we estimate that in 2016,
Wikipedia was responsible for between $114,500 and $124,200 of , and from
2008 to 2017, Wikipedia annually was responsible for between $49,700 and
$180,900 of S annual revenue. In total, considering only the content
analyzed from two communities and the limited time periods we studied (nine
years of SO activity and only one year of Reddit activity) , Wikipedia may
have been (conservatively) responsible for about $1.7 million in revenue,
entirely from volunteer work of the community. STUDY 2 In this section, we
present a study that addresses RQ2, or What value do Reddit and SO provide
to Wikipedia? For the before-and-after windows for each post (one week
each), we calculated the Edit Count , Editors Gained , Editors Retained,
and Article Page Views (reported daily by the Wikipedia page view API), as
discussed above. Study 2 Results Table 4 shows the full results of our
quantitative before-andafter investigation into RQ2. The clearest trend in
Table 4 is the near -absence of any significant results for both edit
behavior and page views . With regard to edit behavior, on both platforms,
we did not observe a significant increase in editors gained or editors
retained during the week after a Wikipedia -linking post appeared. While we
did observe a n effect for the number of edits from Reddit posts, this
effect is quite small (about 1 edit per 2 posts). If we consider all the
Wikipedia -linking Reddit posts from 2016, this amounts to about 0.00 2

on SO where no other effects were observed. The effect was only 0.0 4 edits
per post, but the presence of this small effect suggests that lower
-quality articles received proportionally more contribution from Reddit and
SO. We discuss the implications below. During this analysis, we also
analyzed the effect of Reddit posts exclusively from the TIL community on
Wikipedia page views, a replication of work by Moyer et al. that used 2012
Reddit data [38]. I n this specific case, we found the increase in page
views corresponded with previous results. However, when including posts
from outside TIL and when looking at SO, we found that the increase in page
views was not statistically significant, indicating that while this result
replicates, it may not generalize (we note that we used the Wikipedia
pageview API, which returns daily statistics, whereas Moyer et al. used ho
urly page views). In other words, we saw no evidence that an arbitrary link
to a Wikipedia page on Reddit and SO significantly increases traffic to the
Wikipedia page in the week following. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Paradox
of Re-use As noted above, a concern that has been raised within the
Wikipedia community is re-use i.e. that the quality of Wikip e base could
decline over the long term through the external re-use of Wikipedia content
(and that t he re -using parties would then suffer as well ) [49]. This
concern leads to the question of whether Wikipedia needs to adapt its
permissive licensing to survive, especially as its content is increasingly
appearing on assistants). Given that we observed that Wikipedia -linking
posts were receiving a great deal of attention and engagement on SO and
Reddit, we were surprised that so little of this attention and engagement
was returned to Wikipedia in the form of page views, edits, and editors. We
hypothesized that the paradox of re-use may be a factor. To understand
exactly how SO and Reddit use content from Wikipedia, we performed a small
-scale qualitative codi ng exercise. Using the same approach to qualitative
coding as the current events analysis , we classified whether each post
matched the following definition of direct reHas text (quoted or
summarized) from article. Two authors conducted a calibration coding and
achieved reasonable inter-rater agreement ( 0.74, 90% agreement; SO: 0.62;
90% agreement), and then one author coded 100 posts with Wikipedia links
per site.</region>
    <region x="316.85" y="73.83" width="245.66" height="550.26"
line_height="11.03" font="BCDHEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT">Our coding analysis
revealed that 79% of Reddit posts had quoted or summarized text from the
linked Wikipedia article, whereas this was true of 33% of SO posts. This
result shows that many posts can be characterized by . These early results
help to expand our understanding of the adox of reMcMahon et al. [33].
McMahon et al. found causal evidence for the paradox of reuse on Google
i.e. Knowledge Card assets in Google search results were capturing views
that would have otherwise gone to Wikipedia . This indic ates a strong
version of the paradox of re-use, in which Google was capturing traffic
that would have gone to Wikipedia. Our (associative) results suggest that a
weak form of the paradox may be occurring in Reddit and SO: t he Wikipedia
links on Reddit and SO posts might have generated new traffic for Wikipedia
(rather than capturing existing traffic), but the re -use of content
directly in Reddit and SO may be mitigating this effect . However, it is
critical to note that our results merely allow this as a possibility:
future work should test this hypothesis directly, ideally through
experimental approaches. Broadening Peer Production Research At a high
level, the results of Study 1 demonstrate that there are important
relationships between different peerproduction communities (with Reddit and
SO themsel ves being peer production communities ). We see that when
content creators on Reddit and SO leverage existing peerproduced content
(i.e. Wikipedia) to create new content in their communities , some of the
and the magnitude of that value is reflective of the requality (in this
case, the quality of Wikipedia articles) . In other words, Reddit and SO
users can take advantage of the work already performed by the Wikipedia
community to post higher value content in their communities with less
effort. These relationships between peer production communities have
important implications for research. Studies of some important variables
such as content quality may want to consider external dependencies and
implications , e.g. Wikipedia article quality matters well outside of
Wikipedia, adding importance to the body of work that studies Wikipedia
quality and how to improve it [6,17,53,54,60,70]. Coverage Biases and
External Entities The work on Wikipedia content biases is another key
research area in the Wikipedia literature that our results suggest should
be examined with a broader lens. Wikipedia (and other UGC communities) have
been shown to over focus on some topics and under-focus on others,

used to suggest re lated Wikipedia articles to improve post quality. FUTURE
WORK AND LIMITATIONS An important direct extension of this work would be to
attempt to replicate our causal analysis on observational data with a
randomized experiment. However, experiment-driven posting behavior could be
seen as deviant by the SO and Reddit communities, so ethical and ecological
validity challenges should be carefully considered. Secondly, while the of
revenue above provide a minor contribution to understanding the economic
implications of volunteer peer-produced content, much more work is needed
in this area. T his paper, along with prior research [33], content creation
efforts generate important economic value well outside the corresponding
communities. Understanding this value could provide intrinsic motivation
for volunteers and incentivize donations from beneficiaries . Some
economists even believe that better understanding this value could produce
improved national GDP estimates [3]. However, moving forward in this space
will be difficult because many of the corporate beneficiaries of volunteer
created content do not release the necessary information for rigorous
estimates. As such, new methods that go beyond our will likely be
necessary, such as using targeted ad buys to estimate actual revenue,
advancing techniques similar to those of Caba&#xF1;as et al. [15], and
attempting to measure the value of volunteer-created content to profitable
machine learning systems. Finally, given that most of our results were not
community specific but rather generalized across Reddit and SO, similar
relationships likely exist between Wikipedia and other discussion-based
communities (e.g. akin to Reddit: Hackernews, Facebook groups; akin to SO:
Quora, Yahoo! Answers). Future work should seek to examine these
relationships, as well as those between these communities and peer-produced
data repositories like OpenStreetMap. CONCLUSION In this paper, we
presented results that identify and quantify relationships between
Wikipedia and the large-scale communities Reddit and Stack Overflow. In
general, we observe a one-way relationship in which Wikipediainfluenced
content adds v alue to the external communities, but no evidence of
substantial contributions in the reverse direction is observed. This
research highlights the value of examining online communities using a broad
lens , as crosscommunity relationships can have large effects.

gender (e.g. [21,35,52]), geography (e.g. [19,27]), and language (e.g.
[20]). Importantly, our results suggest that these biases may be having
ripple effects around the web, including on SO and Reddit. For instance, t
he findings from Study 1 indicate that these biases mean that the TIL
community on Reddit is working from a dataset that disadvantages women,
certain geographies (e.g. ru ral areas [27]), and topics outside of the
cultural sphere of most English speakers. Any posts abo ut these Wikipedia
disadvantaged topics that do appear on TIL are less likely to have a
Wikipedia link (or high -quality link) available, and thus cannot get the
benefits of that link. There is a potential silver lining regarding
coverage biases : while the number of edits contributed to Wikipedia from
Reddit that we observed in Study 2 was quite small in the context of
Wikipedia as a whole , it may be that this effect would be meaningful if
applied to specific under -covered content areas . For instance, if mor e
Wikipedia links were posted on a subreddit for rural issues, the throughput
of edits that is quite small for all of Wikipedia could make non-trivial
improvements to coverage of some rural topics, for which a small number of
edits is a large relative increase in edits. One could also imagine the
Wikipedia community (e.g. WikiProject leaders) working with the moderators
of subreddits in under -covered areas on intentional improvement project s
[53]. This m ight involve rallying these sub reddits to encourage edits to
relevant Wikipedia articles and to encourage members to become long -term
editors. It would be interesting to compare the results of such an effort
to our findings, which would provide an excellent baseline to determine if
the effort was effective. Implications for Reddit and Stack Overflow
McMahon et al. [33] indicated that financially supporting Wikipedia may be
highly incentivized for search companies, and our work suggests that the
same might be true for Reddit and SO (although to a lesser degree). In
other words, our results suggest that by donating to Wikipedia, entities
like SO and Reddit can not only garner goodwill, but also could feasibly
see a return on investment. In general, donations to support staffing and
infrastructure are an understudied aspect of the peer production process,
especially relative to their importance. Our results indicate that one di
rection of research in this space that might be fruitful is identifying
formal value propositions for external consumers of peer-produced content.
Our results also suggest that Reddit and SO design interventions could help
increase the mutual value of Wikipedia-SO and Wikipedia -Reddit
relationships. For instance, Reddit and SO could implement a feature that
detects when linked peer produced content is low quality or under-covered
and directly encourage users to contribute. By improving Wikipedia content,
this would in turn add value to the Reddit and SO and could even be
gamified, e.g. giving Similarly, to facilitate higher-quality posts on
Reddit and SO , topic</region>
