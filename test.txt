This is my paper. It's a very interesting paper, as evidenced by Mr. Smith giving it a favorable rating. 
I'm hoping this paper will help me become a better Ph.D student and eventually earn my Ph.D..

I'm friends with 50% of people in my neighborhood.
As you can see in the histogram in Fig. 3, the distribution of ages in our neighborhood is normal.
