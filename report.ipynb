    "# Citation Needed? Automatically Detecting Sentences from Computing Research Papers that Need Citations\n",

    "## Abstract: \n",
    "The scientific paper is the primary artifact produced by scientists of every discipline. Within a scientific paper, citations are incredibly valuable: they help connect a paper to the surrounding literature, provide evidence for claims, and empower a single PDF (often with less than 10 pages) to “stand on the shoulders of giants” by referencing prior work. However, language is ambiguous, and it may not always be trivial to decide whether a certain sentence should include a citation or not.  Therefore, it may be valuable for an author or reviewer to be able to quickly identify whether a sentence should include a citation or not. We implement and test a variety of machine learning classifiers that attempt to solve this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we explore two distinct approaches to classification: (1) using word-level features (i.e. bag-of-words) alongside textual metadata with traditional classification techniques (Naive Bayes, trees, logistic regression, etc) and (2) using character-level features with a deep learning techniques (recurrent neural networks, long-short term memory). We find that for a small dataset (every sentence from 20 computing research papers) logistic regression performs the best.\n",

    "## Organization of this Notebook\n",
    "The main content of this notebook is organized based on the project guidelines for EECS349. At the end of the notebook is an appendix which goes into greater details about project details that are not specifically related to machine learning (e.g. details about the data cleaning, various examples of our dataset).\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "#### Data Aquisition\n",
    "We generated all training and test data by downloading computing papers as PDF files and converting them to text (detailed below). Each text file was processed so as to split the text into sentences, identify all the sentences with citations, and then strip out the evidence of the citations (e.g. bracketed numbers like \"[1]\") so the data could be fairly for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built two datasets for developing and testing: first we used a \"small\" dataset composed of X papers. This dataset included X different sentences and 11% (X) had citations. The papers for this dataset came exclusively from the PSA Research Group (the author's research lab), so this dataset is appropriate for including example sentences.\n",
